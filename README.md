üîê How to Add a User (for Login)
To log in as a user, you need to manually add your credentials to the JSON file used as the user database.

Open the JSON file (e.g. users.json or whatever it's named in your project) in VS Code.

Add a user object to the file in the following format:

json
Copy code
[
{
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john@example.com",
"password": "123456"
}
// Add more users here if needed
]
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the JSON syntax is valid (especially commas between objects if adding multiple users).

Save the file.

Go back to the browser and log in using the same email and password you just added.
